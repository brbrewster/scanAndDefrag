# scanAndDefrag

ScanAndDefrag.bat is just a short script I created some time back to automate the Windows disk scan and defragmentation. It was created for XP and Vista systems, and I don't know if it will work on newer versions of Windows.

It schedules a disk scan, sets the defragmenter to run before the user profile loads, and then reboots the computer to start the process. 

Once the scans have finished, it shuts the computer down.
